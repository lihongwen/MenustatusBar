## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a** macOS user who monitors system resources,  
**I want** the menubar to display metrics in a compact, precise format with real-time data,  
**So that** I can quickly assess exact system status without wasting menubar space or dealing with confusing display mode options.

**As a** user who finds the current display modes visually unappealing,  
**I want** a single, clean, modern display format,  
**So that** the menubar looks professional and consistent with macOS design language.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** CPU usage is at 45.2%, **When** menubar updates, **Then** it displays "⚡45%" with green colored icon

2. **Given** memory usage is at 72.8%, **When** menubar updates, **Then** it displays "💾73%" with yellow/warning colored icon

3. **Given** user opens settings, **When** viewing display options, **Then** no display mode picker is visible (removed)

4. **Given** menubar shows 4 metrics, **When** viewing menubar, **Then** total width is approximately 120-150pt (compact and space-efficient)

5. **Given** CPU usage changes from 45% to 47%, **When** menubar updates (every 2 seconds), **Then** display updates from "⚡45%" to "⚡47%" smoothly

6. **Given** network has download activity at 2.3 MB/s, **When** menubar updates, **Then** it displays "🌐↓2.3M" in compact format

7. **Given** user views the dropdown dashboard, **When** opening any metric card, **Then** exact percentage values with decimal precision are visible (e.g., "CPU: 45.23%")

8. **Given** multiple metrics are being monitored, **When** viewing menubar, **Then** all metrics use consistent compact format with modern typography and color-coded icons

9. **Given** user opens settings, **When** viewing any settings tab, **Then** UI uses modern card-based layout with improved spacing and visual hierarchy

10. **Given** icon color reflects system load, **When** CPU increases from 45% to 85%, **Then** icon color smoothly transitions from green → yellow → red

### Edge Cases

- What happens when metric value is 100%? → Display "⚡100%" with red icon, no truncation
- What happens when system has no load (0%)? → Display "⚡0%" with green icon
- What happens when network speed exceeds 1 GB/s? → Use G unit: "🌐↓1.2G"
- What happens when decimal value is 45.7%? → Round to integer for menubar: "45%", show decimal in dropdown: "45.7%"
- What happens when menubar space is very limited? → Icons remain visible, values may be shortened (e.g., drop % symbol if needed)
- What happens during rapid value changes? → Display updates smoothly every refresh cycle (default 2s), with 300ms color transition animations

## Design Rationale

### Why Compact Precise Display?

**Problem**: Current display has issues:
- Multiple confusing display modes (4 options)
- Some modes show ranges instead of exact values
- Visual inconsistency across modes
- Wasted menubar space or insufficient information density

**Solution**: Unified compact format (⚡45% 💾72% 💿15% 🌐↓2.3M):
- **Simplicity**: One format for all users, no mode selection needed
- **Precision**: Shows exact real-time values, not approximations
- **Compactness**: ~30-40pt per metric, fits 4 metrics in ~150pt
- **Clarity**: Color-coded icons provide instant visual status
- **Consistency**: Same format across all metrics, predictable layout
- **Modern**: Follows macOS Big Sur+ design language

### Format Design Decisions

**Icon Placement** (Left of value):
- Provides instant visual identification
- Color coding gives immediate status indication
- SF Symbols ensure consistency with macOS

**Value Format** (Integer percentages):
- 45% instead of 45.23% - easier to scan quickly
- Exact values preserved in dropdown for detailed analysis
- Reduces visual clutter while maintaining utility

**Spacing** (Tight but readable):
- 2px icon-to-value: Creates visual unit
- 6px between metrics: Clear separation without wasting space
- Total 150pt for 4 metrics: Fits comfortably in typical menubar

**Smart Units** (Network speeds):
- K/M/G notation familiar to users
- One decimal place balances precision and compactness
- Automatic unit selection (2.3M, not 2300K)

### Why Remove Display Modes?

**Problem**: Multiple display modes:
- Create decision fatigue for users
- Increase maintenance complexity
- Result in inconsistent user experiences
- Some modes (icons only, graph mode) lack sufficient information
- Range-based modes show approximations instead of exact values

**Solution**: Single unified format:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Creates consistent experience for all users
- Simplifies codebase and reduces bugs (eliminate ~500-800 lines)
- Allows focus on perfecting one excellent design
- Eliminates problematic range-based display

### Why UI Modernization?

**Problem**: Current UI design:
- May appear cluttered or dated
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment
- Poor visual hierarchy

**Solution**: Modern design system:
- Follows macOS Big Sur+ design language
- Uses consistent spacing scale (8/16/24px)
- Smooth animations and transitions (150ms/300ms)
- Proper color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- Improves readability and scannability
- Enhances professional appearance

### Space Efficiency Strategy

**Problem**: Menubar space is limited and valuable

**Solution**: Multi-pronged approach:
1. **Compact format**: Remove redundant labels, use icons
2. **Smart abbreviations**: K/M/G instead of KB/MB/GB
3. **Integer display**: Round to whole numbers for menubar
4. **Prioritization**: User can configure which metrics to show
5. **Hover details**: Full information on tooltip
6. **Responsive**: Can hide less critical metrics if space constrained

**Result**: 4 metrics in ~150pt (vs typical 200-250pt for other designs)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing system monitoring services must continue to provide exact metric values
- Color coding system (ColorTheme) must remain functional
- Settings persistence system must support updated configuration structure
- SF Symbols available on macOS 13.0+

### Assumptions
- Users prefer compact precise display over verbose labels
- Color-coded icons provide sufficient visual feedback
- 2-second refresh interval is acceptable for real-time monitoring
- Users can access dropdown for detailed decimal-precision values
- Menubar space is at premium, efficiency matters

- User preference survey shows improved satisfaction with visual design
- Support requests about "confusing display modes" drop to zero
- No complaints about "range-based" or "non-real-time" display

### Technical
- Display mode selection code removed from codebase (~500-800 lines)

- Smooth animations with no dropped frames (60fps)
- Consistent design language across all views
- Icon colors accurately reflect current system state
- Typography clear and readable at 11pt size

### Space Efficiency
- Total menubar width for 4 metrics: ≤150pt (target achieved)
